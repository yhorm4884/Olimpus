#### Necessary Hardware:

##### Server:
- **CPU**: A CPU with multiple cores and support for virtualization is recommended.
- **RAM**: We recommend a minimum of 8 GB of RAM, as React itself requires the installation of many packages and libraries.
- **Storage**: It's important to use SSD drives for faster speeds, with enough storage space for application files and the database.
- **Connectivity**: A high-speed internet connection is mandatory to handle user requests and actions as quickly as possible.

##### Network:
- The server should be configured to allow HTTP (port 80) and HTTPS (port 443) traffic to and from the server.
- A valid domain name should be configured with appropriate DNS records to allow users to access the application.

### 3. WEB STYLE GUIDE. <a name="id3"></a>

#### Design and Style
<table style="border: none">
  <tr>
    <td>
        The design of SportEvents is inspired by its <a src="documentation\Logo-SportEvents.webp"><b>logo</b></a>, using a color palette composed of blue, yellow, and black, which reflect energy, dynamism, and professionalism. The <b style="color: cyan">blue</b> conveys serenity and trust, essential for a management platform; the <b style="color: yellow">yellow</b> brings vitality and optimism, alluding to the sports energy; and the <b style="color: black">black</b> provides a strong contrast that accentuates the seriousness and focus of the platform.
    </td>
    <td>

![Logo Sports Events](./pictures/Logo-SportEvents.webp)
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

#### Typography
- For texts, the <b>Betm-Black</b> font is used, a modern and bold typography that contributes to a strong and decisive visual appearance. This choice reinforces accessibility and readability across all user interfaces, ideal for highlighting headlines and key elements without sacrificing clarity.

#### User Interface (UI)
- We have a minimalist interface, avoiding visual overload and highlighting the most important elements using common colors and shapes. Additionally, we have a responsive design that will ensure a uniform experience both on mobile devices and computers.

#### User Experience (UX)
- The user experience is more fluid, as our application has a navigation structure that allows users to quickly find what they need. It is important to highlight that interactivity is a priority, as we have elements such as dynamic calendars and interactive forms for effective and effortless management.

#### Consistency
- The entire application will maintain aesthetic coherence with the logo and corporate colors, ensuring that users quickly identify and become familiar with the SportEvents brand.

### 4. RESEARCH. <a name="id4"></a>
#### Preliminary Research

<div style="display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: space-between;">
  <p style="flex: 1; text-align: justify; margin-right: 20px;">
    The initial phase of the development of SportEvents involved exhaustive research to understand the current market needs, what clients and merchants are interested in, and how to profit from it. In this research, we examined various existing management systems, notable features of sports operations, and the end-users' expectations in terms of functionality, accessibility, and user experience.

</div>


#### Technologies and Tools

- Various technologies and frameworks were researched to select the most suitable for the project. For example, different solutions for the backend such as Node.js and Django were explored, evaluating their scalability, security, and ease of integration with other tools. For the frontend, frameworks such as React and Angular were considered, deciding on React due to its efficiency in updating user interfaces in real time and its vast developer community.
<img src="https://www.saaspegasus.com/static/images/web/modern-javascript/django-react-header.51a983c82dcb.png">

#### Challenges and Solutions
- During development, not everything worked on the first try. Some of the challenges included:

    - <b>Connection between Django and React:</b> Without much knowledge of how cookies worked between Django and React, we were overwhelmed because in certain browsers the cookies were not processed as they should have been, allowing access to content without the user's session being started.

    - <b>Learning between Django and React:</b> At first, we didn't know, but the only way we can communicate between React and Django is by making requests to the IPs that make the queries and always sending and receiving a JSON response.

#### Evaluation and Feedback
- Continuous testing was carried out, and feedback was collected from beta users to iterate on the development. This was crucial to discard some initial ideas and improve others, ensuring that the final application truly met user needs and enhanced the operational management of sports companies.

<hr>

 - The research and development of SportEvents have been a continuous learning, adaptation, and refinement process. Thanks to meticulous research and active user feedback, we have managed to create a solution that not only meets the technical requirements but also offers an exceptional user experience.

### 6. RISKS AND MEASURES. <a name="id6"></a>

#### Identification of Risks 
- During the development of SportEvents, several technical and operational risks were identified. These included managing the loss of cookies in browsers, data security, and the integration of multiple third-party systems and technologies.

#### Issues and Implemented Solutions
1. <b>High-Concurrency Management:</b>
    - <b>Cookie Issues:</b> The system initially took a long time to load or did not load properly due to cookies.
    - <b>Measure:</b> A microservices architecture was implemented to improve scalability and load management. In addition, caching solutions were integrated, and database queries were optimized to reduce latency.

2. <b>Data Security:</b>
    - <b>Issue:</b> Vulnerabilities in the protection of personal and payment data, exposing the platform to security risks.
    - <b>Measure:</b> Security policies were strengthened, two-factor authentication was implemented, and regular security audits were conducted to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities.


#### Ongoing Risk Evaluation
- To ensure the ongoing resilience of SportEvents against emerging risks, a risk review process has been established that includes regular assessments, penetration testing, and stress simulations. This proactive approach helps identify and mitigate risks before they can significantly impact the operation of the service.

Additionally, communication among teams has been increased to improve coordination and anticipate possible delays.

  
### 9. DEGREE OF COMPLIANCE IN COST. <a name="id9"></a>

#### Cost Control Strategies
- Despite the non-monetary budget, it was crucial to adopt management practices that maximized available resources and ensured compliance with project objectives without economic deviations. The following strategies were adopted:

  1. <b>Use of Free Technologies and Tools:</b>
      - We opted to use software and tools that offer free licenses for educational use or are open-source, such as React for the frontend, Django for the backend, and various libraries available under open licenses.
    
  2. <b>Collaboration and Shared Resources:</b>
      - Leveraging the academic networks available at our center, including test servers and access to specialized software at no additional cost.

  3. <b>Optimization of Time and Effort:</b>
      - A rigorous planning and a clear division of responsibilities were established to ensure team efficiency.
    
#### Actions to Detect and Correct Deviations
1. <b>Regular Monitoring Meetings:</b>
    - Weekly meetings are organized to review progress and adjust workload as needed, ensuring that the project progresses as planned without the need for additional resources.

2. <b>Continuous Testing and Feedback:</b>
    - Implementation of continuous testing and feedback cycles to detect errors and validate functionalities on time, helping to avoid rework that would consume more time and effort.

3. <b>Continuous Evaluation of Priorities:</b>
    - Constant prioritization of tasks based on their importance and feasibility within the context of time and available resources.
